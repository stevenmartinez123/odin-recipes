        <p>
            The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it has become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world. 
            Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with b√©chamel and meat sauce, is well known. The Neapolitan version of this recipe includes 
            among its ingredients tomato sauce, mozzarella, meatballs and Roman ricotta cheese. 
            In Liguria, pesto is used as a sauce, while in Venice the sauce is replaced with red radicchio. 
            The lasagna you eat depends on where you are.
