            Spanish rice is essentially a rice pilaf, but with southwestern flavorings. 
            To make it you brown the raw rice first with onions and garlic, 
            and then cook the rice in chicken broth with added tomatoes.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The browning is essential to the nutty, almost toasty flavor of the rice. 
            And although bouillon can be substituted for the chicken stock, 
            nothing beats homemade chicken stock, whose rich flavor is absorbed by the rice as it cooks.
